They're handy for bundling your code with a human-readable explanation of what's happening at each step. Check out some examples from the [L.A.

    "1. **Remove internal whitespace:** Looking over the data, you probably noticed that some of the values have some unnecessary internal whitespace, which you could fix before you wrote each row to file. Python does not have a built-in string method to remove internal whitespace, unfortunately, but [Googling around](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+remove+internal+whitespace) will yield you a common strategy: Using the `split()` method to separate individual words in the string, then `join()`ing the resulting list on a single space. As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_text = 'hello     world      how are      you?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# split() will turn this into a list of words\n",
    "my_text_words = my_text.split()\n",
    "# ['hello', 'world', 'how', 'are', 'you?']\n",
    "\n",
    "# join on a single space\n",
    "my_text_clean = ' '.join(my_text_words)\n",
    "print(my_text_clean)\n",
    "# prints 'hello world how are you?'\n",
    "\n",
    "# or, as a one-liner\n",
    "my_text_clean = ' '.join(my_text.split())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetch multiple years:** The table we scraped has WARN notices for the current year, but the agency also maintains pages with WARN notices for previous years -- there's a list of them in a section [toward the bottom of the page](https://www.dllr.state.md.us/employment/warn.shtml). See if you can figure out how to loop over multiple pages and scrape the contents of each into a single CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a lookup table:** Each numeric code in the \"WIA Code\" column correspondes to a local area. See if you can figure out how to create a lookup dictionary that maps the numbers to their locations, then as you're looping over the data table, replace the numeric value in that column with the name of the local area instead. Here's a hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    lookup_dict = {\n",
    "        '1': 'hello',\n",
    "        '2': 'world'\n",

    "    # prints None\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fix encoding errors:** You might have noticed a few encoding problems -- e.g., `Nestl√©` is being renedered as `Nestl√É¬©`. This is due to an encoding problem -- the `warn_page.text` is not encoded as `utf-8`. Using `decode()` and `encode()`, see if you can fix this. (Hint! It looks like the state of Maryland is a big fan of `latin-1`.)"
