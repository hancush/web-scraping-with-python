    "\n",
    "There are several ways to write and run Python code on your computer. One way -- the method we're using today -- is to use [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which run in your browser and allow you to intersperse documentation with your code. They're handy for bundling your code with a human-readable explanation of what's happening at each step. Check out some examples from the [L.A. Times](https://github.com/datadesk/notebooks) and [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything#data-and-analyses).\n",
