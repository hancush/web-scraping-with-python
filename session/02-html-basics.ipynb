    "Mostly you'll be dealing with `.html` (HyperText Markup Language) files that might include references to `.css` (Cascading Style Sheet) files, which determine how the page looks, and/or `.js` (JavaScript) files, which add interactivity, and other specially formatted text files.\n",

    "Today, we'll focus on the HTML, which gives structure to the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most HTML elements are represented by a pair of tags -- an opening tag and a closing tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table, for example, starts with `<table>` and ends with `</table>`. The first tag tells the browser: \"Hey! I got a table here! Render it as a table.\" The closing tag (note the forward slash!) tells the browser: \"Hey! I'm all done with that table, thanks.\" Inside the table are nested more HTML tags representing rows (`<tr>`) and cells (`<td>`).\n",
